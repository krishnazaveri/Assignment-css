• What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?
	Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many 
	individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle.
	With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.

• Name a few CSS style components
	At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:
		Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. 
				For example, font-size , width , background-color .
		Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.
		
• What do you understand by CSS opacity?
	The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. 
	Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

• How can the background color of an element be changed?
	To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property.

• How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
	This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. 
	The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. 
	It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
	

• What is the use of the background-position property?
	The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
	By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

• Which property controls the image scroll in the background?
	The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.

• Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
	background property is the shorthand property of all background properties.
	The color property allows to specify the color of an element.

• How to center block elements using CSS1?
	margin :0px auto;

• How to maintain the CSS specifications?
	The Specification defines how CSS properties should be implemented by browser vendors along with detailed algorithms, 
	code samples and tabular information.

		The Specification also include:

			-The syntax and data types of the language
			-Detailed explanation on CSS Selectors
			-How you can assign values to properties
			-The Cascade (the "C" in CSS)
			-How inheritance works
			-The Box Model e.t.c


• What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
	CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
		Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
		Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
		External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

• What is embedded style sheets?
	Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place.
	This is done by embedding the <style></style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.

• What are the external style sheets?
	An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. 
	Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.


• What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
	External style sheets have the following advantages:
		-one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages.
		-you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements.
		-consistent look and feel across multiple web pages.
		-this makes it easier to maintain larger websites.

	Disadvantages of Style Sheets
		-Browser dependency - Style sheets format things slightly differently on different browsers. 
		 Unfortunately, browsers have different support for HTML and style sheets. ...
		-Old Browsers - Some very old browsers (such Netscape Navigator 2) do not support style sheets.


• What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
	A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
	CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

	We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

		-Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
		-Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
		-Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
		-Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
		-Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value

• What are the media types allowed by CSS?
	Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

	Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

		-width and height of the viewport
		-width and height of the device
		-orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
		-resolution
	Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones 
	(such as iPhone and Android phones).


• What is the rule set?
	A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations.
